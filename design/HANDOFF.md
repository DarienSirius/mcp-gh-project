# Refactoring Handoff - User Actions Required

**Branch:** `refactor/resource-crud-architecture`  
**Commit:** `c66a888` - Refactoring infrastructure ready  
**Status:** Waiting for user to run baseline tests

## What Was Set Up (Autonomous)

✅ **Feature Branch Created**
- Branch: `refactor/resource-crud-architecture`
- Isolates refactoring work from main

✅ **Design Documents**
- `design/REFACTORING_PLAN.md` - Complete architecture (31 files, 12 phases)
- `design/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` - TDD workflow, crash detection patterns

✅ **Testing Infrastructure**
- `tests/test_baseline.py` - Validates v0.0.1 works before refactoring
- `scripts/check-refactoring-progress.js` - Tracks progress vs. design

✅ **Progress Checker**
- Run: `npm run check-refactoring`
- Shows: 3% complete (1/31 files, server.py violates 100-line limit)

## What YOU Need to Do (Manual Python Execution)

### Step 1: Run Baseline Tests

```bash
cd C:\Users\victorb\code\.miast0\_\mcp-gh-project
python tests\test_baseline.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
============================================================
BASELINE TESTS - v0.0.1 Server Validation
============================================================

🧪 Test 1: Server starts without errors...
✅ Server started successfully (no immediate crash)

🧪 Test 2: List available tools...
✅ Found 11 tools:
   - list_projects
   - get_project_details
   - create_project
   - update_project_settings
   - get_owner_id
   - add_item_to_project
   - remove_item_from_project
   - list_project_items
   - update_item_field_value
   - get_project_fields

============================================================
RESULTS
============================================================
✅ PASS: Server Startup
✅ PASS: Tools List

🎉 All baseline tests passed!
Safe to begin refactoring.
```

**If Tests Fail:**
- Fix v0.0.1 issues first
- Don't proceed with refactoring until baseline passes

### Step 2: Verify Current MCP Server Works (Optional)

Test in VSCode with Copilot Chat:
```
@workspace list projects for wordgarden-dev
```

Verify tool appears and responds.

### Step 3: Review Design Documents

Read through:
- `design/REFACTORING_PLAN.md` - Architecture overview
- `design/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` - Testing approach

Approve architecture or suggest changes.

## What Agent Will Do Next (After Your Approval)

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- Create directory structure (resources/, graphql/, lib/)
- Create empty `__init__.py` files
- Commit: "chore: Create directory structure"

### Phase 2: Extract GraphQL Queries (Atomic)
- Extract each query to `.graphql` file
- One commit per query
- Example: "refactor: Extract list_projects GraphQL query"

### Phase 3: Base Resource Class
- Create `resources/base.py`
- Create test: `tests/unit/test_base_resource.py`
- YOU run: `python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v`
- Commit: "refactor: Add BaseResource with GraphQL loading"

### Continued Pattern
- Small incremental changes
- Test after each change (YOU run tests)
- Atomic commits
- Check progress: `npm run check-refactoring`

## Key Constraints

❌ **Agent CANNOT:**
- Run Python directly (`python` command blocked by autoApprove)
- Test MCP servers (no visibility into crashes)
- Deploy to live VSCode without your verification

✅ **Agent CAN:**
- Create/edit files autonomously
- Create test files for you to run
- Track progress against design
- Make atomic git commits

## Communication Protocol

**Agent Signals Ready for Testing:**
> "✅ Phase X complete. Please run: `python tests/unit/test_X.py`"

**You Report Results:**
> "Tests passed" OR "Test Y failed with error Z"

**Agent Proceeds or Fixes:**
> Continues to next phase OR fixes issue and signals retry

## Success Criteria

Before merging `refactor/resource-crud-architecture` → `main`:

✅ All unit tests pass  
✅ Baseline tests still pass (no regression)  
✅ Server starts without errors  
✅ All 11 tools appear in MCP client  
✅ Manual testing in VSCode confirms tools work  
✅ `npm run check-refactoring` shows 100% complete  
✅ All files <100 lines (none violate limits)

## Rollback Plan

If refactoring breaks something:
```bash
git log --oneline  # Find last working commit
git checkout <commit-hash>  # Rollback
# OR
git revert <bad-commit>  # Undo specific change
```

## Current Status

📍 **Waiting for User Action**
- Run baseline tests
- Approve architecture
- Signal ready to proceed

Once you confirm baseline passes and approve the design, I'll begin Phase 1 (Infrastructure Setup) with atomic commits.

**Question for You:** Should I proceed with the refactoring plan as documented, or do you want to adjust the architecture first?
